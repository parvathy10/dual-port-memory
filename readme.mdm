Overview

This repository contains the design and implementation of a dual-port memory module.


Dual-port memory is a type of memory architecture that allows for two separate data accesses (reads or writes) to occur simultaneously. Unlike traditional memory, which typically supports only one operation at a time, dual-port memory features two independent sets of data and address lines, known as ports. Each port can operate independently, enabling concurrent access from different parts of a system without conflicts.

This flexibility makes dual-port memory well-suited for applications requiring high-speed data transfers, parallel processing, and efficient sharing of memory resources among multiple processors or subsystems. It is commonly used in networking devices, digital signal processing systems, multiprocessing environments, and other scenarios where simultaneous data access is essential for optimal performance.
